![screencast](https://github.com/ndecker/atc/blob/master/atc.gif)

ATC is a air traffic controller game based on [ATC.exe](http://atc.fastie.com/).
The game is described in [ATCs manual](http://atc.fastie.com/downloads/original/ATC_Users_Guide.pdf)

There are a couple of differences to the origninal game:

 * Multiple game boards
 * New Aircraft types: Helicopter moves slower, can hoover and turn on the spot. Blackbird is very fast.
 * Option skip time to the beginning of the next 15s tick. The original game always skips 15s.
 * Option to delay commands to the next tick. ("turn left in two ticks")
 * Help Menu (?)
